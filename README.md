How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

Designing software takes a careful approach in my eyes. Things that help me are double-reading and checking for syntax errors. Through this process, the more I do the work the more my design skills for checking my own errors faster is become less and less. It's still fully a work in the making but more practice makes me a better coder. First, when beginning everything I laid out what I wanted the image to be displayed so you even know what you're coding for whether cylinder, box, or other things. 

How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

To approach developing programs I make sure to know the change I'm looking to get out of  the system, and what areas need to be changed for necessary change. I am working on remembering to add comments. That helped when it was time to return even though I thought it would do nothing for me. Making sure I wasn't adding unnecessary things also was something I caught myself doing that wasn't something I knew I did. When iteration factored itself into my development process  


How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Computer Science can help me get a great job and break into generation wealth for my future and the little futures to come. Everything in computational graphics and visualization can be applied professionally and educationally. Whether I pass down to my children the education I was taught. Making it where with a little help and no degree they could become the greatest coder possible. Or even helping me become IBM or Google's best coder getting paid the top bucks.
